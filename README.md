The purpose of this website is to mirror the prototype provided by the coding bootcamp curriculum in \bootcamp\FSF-PT-EAST-MAY-050624-A\02-Advanced-CSS\02-Challenge\Assets\02-advanced-css-homework-demo.gif.

Modeling the prototype allows me to apply the lessons learned during the first two weeks of coding bootcamp.

At the top of the page is the title with a dark blue background with my userid in dark blue in a light blue box on the left. On the right, are four non-executable hyper-links..."About Me," "Work," "Contact Me," and "Resume" in light blue.

Beneath the title is the cover with light blue and dark blue stripes on an angle for left to right. The verbiage "My Profile" in dark blue text within a light blue box is in the lower right of the cover.

There are three sections that follow the cover. They are titled on the left side of the page in dark blue with a font size of 24. After each title, there is a dark blue vertical bar to separate the title from the content that relates to the title.

The first section is "About Me." The content is not about me, but consists of random words copied from the prototype with font size of 12.

The second section is "Work." The section contains five pictures as a placeholder for future use. There are three rows of these images. The top row is one image across the content. The middle and bottom rows have two images evenly split across the content.

The third section is "Contact Me." The section includes five non-executable hyper-links in dark blue. They are my cell phone number, email address, verbiage "Github," "Twitter," and "Spotify."

The page does have media query functionality. As the page shrinks, the title background will change colors and the links will get smaller in size.

As the coding bootcamp progresses, I will be updating this website with details about me and my work. Also, the code will be udpated for easier readability and maintenance as well as modified with new functionality added (i.e., working links).
